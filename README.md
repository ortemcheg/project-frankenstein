# Project Frankenstien

## Overview

I created this project to advance my skills in Node.js, configuring the TypeScript compiler, Telegram API, OpenAI API, GitHub Actions, and maybe other technologies. These are areas that interest me very much, but I can’t find enough time to practice them in a systematic way, so I am going to have fun with these pieces of technology here. Under H2 headings, I’ll be adding things that I find interesting, surprising, or valuable about the tech that I’m using here. Working on this project will also allow me to maintain some valuable knowledge, which tends to fade away if I don’t practice it for some time.
